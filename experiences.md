# niployments
## Overview
This project is a restructuring of the infrastructure at the Informatics Club. This system is responsible for hosting all of the projects developed by the group (around 3-4 projects).
## Technologies/Skills
- DevOps
- Kubernetes
- Ansible
- Linux
- Docker

## What did I do?
**Contributing to this project was a challenge for me, since I had never even touched anything like it**, so first I had to learn how it worked and a little about the technologies involved. For that, **I started with the Kubernetes Bootcamp on their website, some Docker tutorials and a lot of documentation from the Ansible team**.

Even after all of that, my contributions were somewhat sub-optimal and I wish I had made more contributions (which I plan to do this next academic year). **My real contributions were setting up a DHCP server and fixing an issue with a failsafe protocol.**

## What have I learned?
Even if my contributions were not really significant, **I feel like I've learned tons about DevOps, GitHub Actions and everything related to infrastructure and how all of that works**.

For that, I give my sincere thanks to [Luis Duarte](https://github.com/LuisDuarte1/) and [José Costa](https://github.com/Sirze01), who were the minds behind the whole project and **the people who fueled even more my passion for working on something great**.
